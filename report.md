# Reflection on our Team

Based on the Essence checklist, we'd say that our team is currently in the **Collaborating** state. All team members are focused on achieving the team mission. We communicate openly and honestly within the team, and team members are getting to know and trust each other more and more, sharing progress and challenges. We also think that our team is functioning as a cohesive unit by helping each other and coordinating the work effectively. However, we have not yet worked together long enough to say that the team "continuously adapts to changing context" or that we yet have all the skills necessary to continuously be able to identify and eliminate "wasted work". Nonetheless, we give each other feedback, discuss improvements openly, and are learning how to coordinate and refine our workflow, moving toward the **Performing** state, where these practices would become natural and consistent.
